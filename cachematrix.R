## The two functions in this code combine to:
## -create a matrix object
## -allow access to the object in order to set the value, retrieve the value.
## -calculate the inverse of the matrix and store the result in a "cache" variable
## -If the inverse has already been calculated, the previous result will be retrieved
##  without being recalculated, so as to save on processing time

## functions do

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
